# Student Guide: How to Read Your KLSI 4.0 Profile

This guide explains each block of the KLSI 4.0 report in friendly, non-judgmental language. All interpretations follow *The Kolb Learning Style Inventory 4.0 – Guide to Theory, Psychometrics, Research & Applications* and our internal summary `docs/psychometrics_spec.md`. Remember: KLSI 4.0 is a formative instrument for reflection, **not** a selection or diagnostic tool.

## 1. First Steps

1. **Ensure completeness** – the assessment must include all 12 learning-style items and 8 LFI contexts.
2. **Open your report** – usually available at `/reports/{session_id}` or via PDFs shared by your facilitator.
3. **Reflect while it’s fresh** – insights land better when you review the results soon after finishing the questionnaire.

## 2. Report Panels at a Glance

| Panel | Contents | How to read it |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Learning Style Summary | Primary style, intensity score, backup style | Highlights your current preference, not a permanent label. Use it to kick off self-reflection.
| Mode & Dialectic Distribution | CE/RO/AC/AE totals plus ACCE/AERO | Check the Low/Mid/High bands to see which areas feel most natural and which need more deliberate practice.
| Learning Space / Kite | Position on the ELT quadrants | Track how your point moves over time as you collect new experiences.
| Learning Flexibility Index | Value 0–1 with level (Low/Med/High) | Indicates how smoothly you can rotate around the cycle. Follow the suggested drills to strengthen weaker moves.
| Norms & Percentiles | Percentiles per mode/dialectic + balance heuristics | Percentiles come from the norm group resolved for you; balance percentiles are heuristic distance metrics.
| Meta-Learning & Recommendations | Narrative summary and concrete tips | Turn these into a 2–4 week learning plan.

## 3. Connect Results to the ELT Cycle

- **Concrete Experience (CE)** – learning via direct participation. Ask yourself, “When was the last time I jumped into a new activity?”
- **Reflective Observation (RO)** – pausing to make meaning. Schedule journaling time after important events.
- **Abstract Conceptualization (AC)** – linking experiences to theory. Map insights to models or frameworks discussed in class.
- **Active Experimentation (AE)** – testing ideas. Design mini experiments or prototypes.

Use your KLSI results to ensure upcoming coursework touches all four modes even if one feels dominant.

## 4. 4-Week Action Plan

1. **Week 1: Observe** – log situations where your dominant style shows up.
2. **Week 2: Experiment** – pick a recommendation from the report and try it in class or projects.
3. **Week 3: Reflect** – journal about what changed when you practiced a less dominant mode.
4. **Week 4: Share** – discuss insights with peers or mentors; compare notes on how everyone is rotating through the cycle.

## 5. Quick FAQ

**Can my learning style change?**  
Yes. ELT emphasizes adaptation to new experiences. You may retake KLSI after major learning blocks to observe shifts.

**What does a low percentile mean?**  
It simply shows your relative position within the norm group. Use low scores as a cue to create deliberate practice, not as a value judgment.

**What are balance percentiles?**  
They are heuristic distances from the normative center (ACCE≈9, AERO≈6). They are **not** population percentiles and should only signal dialectic balance.

**Do these results affect grades?**  
No. They support reflection and course design, not grading or employment decisions.

**Who can see my data?**  
Only you, your assigned facilitator, and approved learning staff. See `docs/frontend_readiness.md §6` for privacy specifics.

## 6. Reflection Checklist

- [ ] I understand my primary and backup styles, plus the intensity score.
- [ ] I identified one mode to strengthen deliberately.
- [ ] I selected at least one concrete recommendation to try this week.
- [ ] I know who to talk to (lecturer, mentor, peer) about my plan.
- [ ] I stored a copy of the report for comparison with future sessions.

There is no “best” style. The power of ELT lies in rotating through the entire cycle to match each learning challenge.
